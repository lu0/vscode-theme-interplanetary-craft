# Interplanetary Craft Dark Theme

A custom VSCode Theme extension I made based on Monokai. This is the dark theme I use on my [setup](https://github.com/lu0/vscode-settings).

## Installation

Install the packaged extension with the following command:

```sh
code --install-extension output/interplanetary-craft-dark-theme-1.0.0.vsix
```

Or if you prefer to compile it from source by yourself:

```sh
sudo apt install npm
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
vsce package -o output/
code --install-extension output/interplanetary-craft-dark-theme-1.0.0.vsix
```

Then select the theme (`Interplanetary Craft Dark`) in VSCode.
